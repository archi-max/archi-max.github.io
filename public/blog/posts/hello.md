# First Blog!

by **Ansh Tulsyan** · 20 Feb 2026

<br />

I've been meaning to start writing for a while. This is that.

I'm a CE student at UIUC and a part-time research scientist at AMD, where I work on AI tooling for chip design verification. Outside of that, I build things across the stack — operating systems, FPGA controllers, CUDA kernels, custom PCBs, and whatever else catches my interest.

This blog is a place to write about what I'm learning. Expect posts on:

- **Systems** — OS internals, kernel development, the kinds of things you learn when you write a RISC-V kernel from scratch and then try to run DOOM on it
- **Hardware** — FPGA design, RTL verification, embedded firmware, PCB bring-up
- **AI/ML** — LLM tooling, CUDA optimization, evaluation methodology, the gap between research and production
- **Building things** — project writeups, technical decisions, what worked and what didn't

No schedule, no promises on frequency. I'll write when I have something worth saying.

If you want to follow along, I'm [@\_\_ansht](https://twitter.com/__ansht) on Twitter and [archi-max](https://github.com/archi-max) on GitHub.
