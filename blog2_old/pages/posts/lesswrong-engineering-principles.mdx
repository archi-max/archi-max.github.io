<p>
  Rationality ideas translate surprisingly well into day-to-day engineering. Here are a few heuristics I lean on to
  keep projects moving while avoiding the common reliability traps.
</p>

<h2 id="make-beliefs-pay-rent">1) Make beliefs pay rent</h2>
<p>
  If you believe a migration will be easy, what concrete prediction does that imply? “We can ship to 10% traffic by
  Friday with no error-rate regression” is a belief that pays rent; you can check it. Anything fuzzier is wishful
  thinking.
</p>

  Ask: what would I see in Grafana next week if this belief were wrong?

<h2 id="plan-for-adversarial-failure-modes">2) Plan for adversarial failure modes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Double-check retry storms: do retries amplify the failure?</li>
  <li>Throttle fan-out: bound concurrency and queue depth before adding more capacity.</li>
  <li>Design degraded modes: a slower, simpler path is often better than total failure.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shorten-the-feedback-loop">3) Shorten the feedback loop</h2>
<p>
  Long feedback loops grow unknowns. Ship a guard-railed slice early: feature flags, shadow reads, or write-ahead logs
  for inspection. The goal is to observe reality before you’re committed.
</p>

<h2 id="narrate-uncertainty">4) Narrate uncertainty</h2>
<p>
  Share what you don’t know. “Perf is fine on dev, unknown on prod-like data” is actionable. Teammates can help you
  reduce uncertainty or at least plan mitigations.
</p>

<h2 id="write-incident-pre-mortems">5) Write incident pre-mortems</h2>
<p>
  Before flipping the switch, write a two-minute pre-mortem: “If this goes wrong, it will be because…”. You’ll surface
  hidden couplings and monitoring gaps.
</p>

<h2 id="prefer-reversible-steps">6) Prefer reversible steps</h2>
<p>
  Default to changes you can quickly undo: dual writes with tombstoning, toggle-driven rollouts, and small DB schema
  steps. Reversibility beats courage.
</p>

<h2 id="optimize-for-future-you">7) Optimize for future you</h2>
<p>
  Leave breadcrumbs: concise docs, a runbook link in the dashboard, and one paragraph explaining the weird tradeoff
  you made. Future you (or your teammate) will thank you at 3 AM.
</p>
