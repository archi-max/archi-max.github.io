  <p>
    Rationality ideas translate surprisingly well into day-to-day engineering. Here are a few heuristics I lean on to
    keep projects moving while avoiding the common reliability traps.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Make beliefs pay rent</h2>
  <p>
    If you believe a migration will be easy, what concrete prediction does that imply? “We can ship to 10% traffic by
    Friday with no error-rate regression” is a belief that pays rent; you can check it. Anything fuzzier is wishful
    thinking.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Ask: what would I see in Grafana next week if this belief were wrong?
  </blockquote>

  <h2>2) Plan for adversarial failure modes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-check retry storms: do retries amplify the failure?</li>
    <li>Throttle fan-out: bound concurrency and queue depth before adding more capacity.</li>
    <li>Design degraded modes: a slower, simpler path is often better than total failure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Shorten the feedback loop</h2>
  <p>
    Long feedback loops grow unknowns. Ship a guard-railed slice early: feature flags, shadow reads, or write-ahead logs
    for inspection. The goal is to observe reality before you’re committed.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Narrate uncertainty</h2>
  <p>
    Share what you don’t know. “Perf is fine on dev, unknown on prod-like data” is actionable. Teammates can help you
    reduce uncertainty or at least plan mitigations.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Write incident pre-mortems</h2>
  <p>
    Before flipping the switch, write a two-minute pre-mortem: “If this goes wrong, it will be because…”. You’ll surface
    hidden couplings and monitoring gaps.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Prefer reversible steps</h2>
  <p>
    Default to changes you can quickly undo: dual writes with tombstoning, toggle-driven rollouts, and small DB schema
    steps. Reversibility beats courage.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Optimize for future you</h2>
  <p>
    Leave breadcrumbs: concise docs, a runbook link in the dashboard, and one paragraph explaining the weird tradeoff
    you made. Future you (or your teammate) will thank you at 3 AM.
  </p>
